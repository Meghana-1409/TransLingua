# TransLingua – AI-Powered Multi-Language Translator 
TransLingua is a web-based AI-powered language translation application built using **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini Generative AI**.  
It allows users to translate text between multiple languages through a simple and interactive interface.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Generative AI**, **cloud-based APIs**, and **secure software development practices**.

##  How to Run the Project


1. Create virtual environment (one time)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
2. Activate virtual environment
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
 You’ll see (venv) in terminal — that means it worked 

3.  Install dependencies (VERY IMPORTANT)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Do this once after activating venv)

4. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run translang.py
```
OR (safer version, always works):
```bash
python -m streamlit run translang.py
```

he TransLingua AI-Powered Language Translator is deployed and accessible online.
## Security Practices

API keys are stored securely using environment variables

.env and venv folders are excluded using .gitignore

No sensitive or personal information is uploaded to GitHub

## Use Cases

Global business communication

Academic research collaboration

Travel and tourism assistance

Language learning support

## Conclusion

TransLingua demonstrates how Generative AI can be effectively used to overcome language barriers through a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web application.
This project reflects real-world AI integration and follows best practices suitable for academic and internship evaluation.
